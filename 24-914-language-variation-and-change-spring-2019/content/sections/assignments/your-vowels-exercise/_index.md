Due session 5

Using the handout on [Wells’ standard lexical sets (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/your-vowels-exercise/mit24_914s19_lexicalsets) as a guide, identify the vowel phonemes in your dialect of English and transcribe their basic realizations. The second examples on the handout are often a better guide to basic realizations than the keywords.
